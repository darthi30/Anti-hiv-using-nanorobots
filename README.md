The study on Anti-hiv using nanorobots

ABSTRACT:


The initial part of the paper is focused on describing the level of HIV infection affected in the human body's immune system using nanotechnologies. The main purpose is to make the treatment more specific. Nanorobots are used for providing protection against pathogens in human cells. The basic goal is to know about the nanotechnology with clear data and to sense the HIV infected WBC'S. Nanorobots is used to delivery the drug to the infected area in human body. The drugs works through the entire body before they deliver the drug to the infected area and kills the infected cells. This paper includeds different types of Nanorobots/ robotics and components of Nanorobots. This is followed by the fact sheets statistics of global HIV infection data. It includes information by that can HIV be controlled.

The uses of Nanorobots technologies will make the recoverable treatment more effective an efficient.
